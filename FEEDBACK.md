This was a fun challenge!  I thoroughly enjoyed the 'open-ended-ness' of it all, where we could use whatever frameworks and libraries we wanted.  Thank you for that!

I chose to actually throw the User Group selections into a database and have it link up, as I wanted to deploy this app to Heroku, and wanted a cleaner solution before deployment.  

Hope you enjoy looking through my code, have a great day!  

Best,

Ryan
